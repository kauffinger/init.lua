# init.lua
This is my personal nvim setup, based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and some stolen binds from [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua).

# Requirements
Only guaranteed to be working with the latest nvim builds (get them [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly)).
